Hi, I'm BergiTech, a tech enthusiast with a deep interest in hardware hacking, UART communication, homelab configurations, and PCB repair. 
I enjoy combining both software, hardware and 3D-Printing to solve real-world problems, and I’m passionate about reverse engineering and improving electronics.

I hope to make my GitHub a collection of projects and resources where I explore and document my experiments. 
Whether it’s communicating with embedded systems through UART, setting up a homelab for experimentation, or repairing PCBs, I share my knowledge and solutions to help others in the community. 

My Interests:

> UART Hacking: Exploring and interacting with embedded devices using UART communication or via Chip-Off analysis

> Homelab Setup: Configuring servers, networks, and automation systems to optimize home labs for learning and experimentation.

> PCB Repair: Diagnosing and fixing issues with printed circuit boards, from simple trace repairs to component replacements.

I believe in hands-on learning and love to collaborate on open-source hardware projects. Feel free to check out my repositories, share ideas, or reach out if you’re interested in working together!
